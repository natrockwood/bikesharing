# Bike Sharing Analysis in NYC & Des Moines

New York City versus Des Moines, Iowa--those are two *very* different types of cities and types of lifestyles. This analysis shows how a bike sharing business in a large city can be adapted in a smaller town by looking at where people go. In this case, we took a look at the different McDonald's restaurants there were in each city. First, we dig into the data of New York City and it's bikesharing business, "Citi Bike".

In the [NYC Citi Bikes Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nathania.rockwood#!/vizhome/bikesharing_tableau_15921583395810/NYCCitiBikes?publish=yes), Page 2 displays a great number of starting locations of bikes. Knowing that NYC is a metropolitan area, this is definitely not a surprise. The streets of New York consist of mostly taxis and Uber drivers. Subways, walking, and definitely, biking are some of the primary modes of transportation according to [NYC's Official Guide](https://www.nycgo.com/plan-your-trip/basic-information/transportation-in-nyc/getting-around/).

This page also shows that the average trip durations are higher for the younger generation. We will be able to see the different age demographics in the 
[McDonald's Density Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nathania.rockwood#!/vizhome/mcdonalds_15920836062530/McDoDensity?publish=yes) to help us come up with a high level *story* to how a bikesharing business would benefit the city of Des Moines. This Tableau Story also shows the relationship between McDonald's restaurants and the populations of both NYC and Des Moines, and answers the question "*Does the density of McDonald's in a city affect where people go?*"

A huge chunk of the population of NYC consists of people aged 19 to 65. A very popular generation is in that range--the millennials. There are around 8 million people in New York City alone, and comparing that number to the population of Des Moines is definitely out of range. However, data shows that 57% of Des Moines' population consists of the same age range. From the [NYC Citi Bikes Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nathania.rockwood#!/vizhome/bikesharing_tableau_15921583395810/NYCCitiBikes?publish=yes), we know that millennials are the people that use bikes for a longer period of time. Knowing this piece of data is pretty useful!

The second page of the story also shows us a summary of most visited fast food places and restaurants by generation, thanks to analysts at [Morgan Stanley](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-go-to-mcdonalds-the-most-2015-3). From this, we can see that those that visit McDonald's the most are the millennials and Gen Z generations.

From an assumption, one would think that New York City would have a lot of McDonald's restaurants given that they're like Starbucks cafes--at almost every street and corner. Data, as it always does, tells us otherwise. There are 11 McDonald's restaurants in NYC. Surprisingly, there are also 11 restaurants in Des Moines. The only difference is that NYC McDonald's are a little closer together than those in Des Moines.

Since the McDonald's are most far apart in Des Moines, people would most likely take a different mode of transportation than just walking. Millennials are also the main customers at McDonald's. Since we know they populate well over half of Des Moines' population, we can assure that they'll be going to a McDonald's no matter what else is around. That said, the denstiy of McDonald's in an area, **does** affect where people would go.
